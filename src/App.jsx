  //token (Local Storage): The token stored in localStorage is persistent across page reloads. It acts as a fallback to verify that the user was previously authenticated, even after a refresh. If isLoggedIn is false after a refresh but the token is still present, you can use the token to set isLoggedIn back to true.
